# Where is the Next Power Outage?

## Introduction


## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
The data cleaning process aimed to ensure the integrity and usability of the dataset for subsequent analysis. The initial steps involved adjusting the DataFrame's structure, such as setting the appropriate column names and removing extraneous rows. This ensured that the data aligns correctly with its intended format and layout.

Following this, date and time information, crucial for understanding outage durations and restoration times, was consolidated into single datetime columns. This consolidation facilitates easier analysis of outage events over time and enables the calculation of outage durations.

Addressing missing or invalid values is vital to prevent skewing analysis results. The process involved replacing various representations of missing data, such as 'NaN', 'N/A', or 'na', with a consistent representation, `pd.NA`, signifying missing values.

Ensuring correct data types is essential for accurate analysis. Consequently, columns representing numerical values, such as observation counts, years, and months, were converted to the appropriate integer data type. Additionally, the 'MONTH' column, which occasionally contained missing values, was first filled with zeros before conversion to integers to maintain data consistency.

Finally, columns containing date and time information were converted to datetime objects, facilitating easier manipulation and analysis of temporal data.

Overall, these data cleaning steps aimed to prepare the dataset for subsequent exploratory data analysis and modeling. The cleaned DataFrame now exhibits a standardized structure, consistent data types, and appropriately handled missing values, providing a solid foundation for further analysis.
